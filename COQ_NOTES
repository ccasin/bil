- Eliminated "S" and "M" designation from many productions, because this
  requires us to translate them away in Coq, but no obvious
  translation was available.

  Did this for insn, seq (where we do want a list form in coq, which
  is what gets generated without "S"), and var.  Also for all of "val"

  Also for the "ifthen" production of statements.  This could be
  syntax sugar if we could translate it away to "if e seq else nop",
  but there's no nop or sequence of instructions equivalent to nop in
  the current statement grammar.  Probably nop should be added?
